title: draft Rapid Development Cycle with Scala, Akka, and sbt
---
Performance is a feature. Studies have proven than today's fickle consumers loss in interest is measurable in hundreds of milliseconds.
While attention span of a motivated developer is considerably longer than that, it is equally important than any unnecessary delays and ceremonies
will be removed. This allows the developer to stay focused by providing instant feedback and removing extra distractions.


I have been recently working with Akka and sbt.  
One of the nice features of SBT is the [triggered execution](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Triggered-Execution.html) feature that can be used
to automatically compile and run the application when the source has changed. However, this feature is not very useful with Akka applications which will stay active  
until explicitly shutdown. Ideally, there would be a mechanism that would shut down the actorsystem when the sources have changed to allow the sbt triggered execution to recompile and rerun the application.
In this post I present one such solution.
